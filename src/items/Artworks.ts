After many rounds of creative (and budget) meetings, it was decided to stick with a 4' robotic bear and to have him move about a university campus always late. The location was to resemble a \"Harry Potter\" quality, so we shot on location at Princeton University. I was able to get Louis Vuitton designed a custom backpack for the bear.\"",
